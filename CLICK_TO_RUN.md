## ❌ NOT WORKING?

### Problem 1: "npm: command not found"
- Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
- Close and reopen terminal

### Problem 2: "Port 5504 already in use"
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5504

# Mac/Linux
lsof -i :5504
```
Then kill the process or use different port:
```bash
npm --workspace app run dev -- -p 3002
```

### Problem 3: "Cannot connect to backend"
- Make sure you see `API server listening on http://localhost:4000`

npm --workspace server run dev
```
